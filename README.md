### :rocket: Setup instructions : :rocket:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **settings.py :** update ( or add if missing ) the static files root path field as follows :

> STATIC_ROOT ='/static/'

&nbsp;

- **requirements.txt :** Make sure you update or create a requirements.txt file in your project directory ( the directory also containing the manage.py file ). Your requirements.txt file should list **at least** django and gunicorn 

```
#requirements.txt

django 
gunicorn
# Pin versions as you need
```
&nbsp;

- **Update the entrypoint.sh :** so it knows where to look for the wsgi file

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Move this repo content** into your django project directory
```script
mv django_auto_prod_deploy/* <your_django_project_path>

```
